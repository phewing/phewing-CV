# Recent Experience

## Perkins+Will | Atlanta, GA

### May 2016 – Present | Researcher, Neuroarchitecture Lab

#### General Responsibilities

Produced software tools, building performance analyses, presentations, research articles, and other materials for multiple research groups, supporting initiatives for:

+ Conducting and publishing applied research on new tools and methodologies for enhancing the quantitative and qualitative performance of building designs.

+ Advising project teams on design strategies for client projects by performing building simulations, user surveys and data analytics.

+ Educating design students and professionals on building simulation tools and data-informed design methodologies.

#### Neuroarchitecture Lab (Formerly Human Experience Lab)

+ Circadian light tracker: Won and executed a firmwide “innovation incubator” research grant to design, fabricate, and program (Arduino SDK, C/C++) a wearable circadian light tracker equipped with 13 + 1 (spectral + photopic) light sensors, and presented project results to the Perkins+Will Atlanta office. (Publication and further development options currently being actively explored.)

+ Circadian light analysis: Created a proof-of-concept for and conducted preliminary validation of ‘pChroma’, a novel analysis tool (Grasshopper, Python, Radiance) and methodology for simulating the impact of building designs on human circadian rhythms, in compliance with recent photobiologic research citing five (“pentachromic”) spectral determinants for circadian photoentrainment. Working directly with research lab directors (Drs. John Haymaker and Eve Edelstein), successfully led submission, publication, and presentation of a paper detailing research work for the IBPSA (International Building Performance Simulation Association) Building Simulation 2017 conference. Initiated partnerships with researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and University of Southern California (USC) for potential future research collaboration.

+ Thermal comfort: Reporting directly to the CEO (Phil Harrison, FAIA), led a team of four Neuroarchitecture Lab researchers in designing and deploying an online survey assessing employee thermal comfort in the Perkins+Will Atlanta office, as well as evaluating and reporting survey results.

+ Architectural psychoacoustics: Worked with the Neuroarchitecture Lab director (Dr. Eve Edelstein) in designing and deploying protocols for assessing speech intelligibility, ambient noise levels, and other psychoacoustic properties of spaces using industrial-grade sound level and noise dose meters (Brüel & Kjær), sound analysis software, and building occupant hearing tests (adapted from HINT and SIN surveys). Instructed Neuroarchitecture lab colleagues in conducting psychoacoustic measurements and surveys.

#### Energy Lab

+ Simulation Platform for Energy Efficient Design (SPEED): Contributed as one of the primary software developers for the successful beta deployment of SPEED, an online application for designers to parametrically evaluate the energy performance of an arbitrary number of permutations of typical building geometries and constructions via distributed, scalable AWS virtual machine instances running OpenStudio Server, Node.js, Angular.js, and MongoDB. Primary contributions included front-end JS development for tasks including (but not limited to): debugging geometry import/rendering in Three.js; Google Maps API integration for location specification and map overlay visualization; solar position calculation and analemma plotting; export of Three.js geometry to gbXML and RAD file formats for server-side daylight and energy analysis; and miscellaneous UX features debugging. Implemented additional analysis features in the form of Python, Ruby, and R scripts.

#### Design Process Lab

+ Design Space Construction (DSC): Contributed to the development (Grasshopper, Python, Radiance, EnergyPlus) of DSC, a workflow for multi-objective exploration and optimization of building design performance based on multiple quantitative (e.g., EUI) and qualitative (e.g., view quality) indicator metrics. Served as a contributing author to a journal article describing the DSC methodology in ITCon (Journal of Information Technology in Construction), as well as a workshop at the 2016 ACADIA conference (Association for Computer-Aided Design in Architecture) and presentations at Autodesk University in 2017 and 2018.

+ Space Plan Generator: Evaluated and advised algorithmic improvements to software engineers for development of software tools (Dynamo C# SDK) of an automated Space Plan Generator (SPG), a set of Dynamo plugins for automated generation of floor plan design options based specification of program entities and adjacencies via spreadsheet input. Assisted in multiple internal workshops for instructing Perkins+Will healthcare planners on how to use SPG for generating floor plan options for client projects.

+ Client projects: Applied the DSC performance analysis methodology for advising multiple Perkins+Will project teams on building design performance indicators and potential improvement strategies.

+ Teaching engagements: Contributed curriculum and documentation for workshops on design space construction taught to two semesters of graduate-level architecture students at the University of Washington (Seattle), as well as two semesters of 4th-year architecture undergraduate students at Auburn University. 


#### Building Technology Lab

+ Thermoplastic robotics: Collaborated with Building Technology Lab (Tech Lab) and Autodesk BUILD space researchers in exploring designer-centric workflows for digital fabrication of thermoformed plastic structural systems using multiple, synchronized industrial robotic arms controlled via Grasshopper, Dynamo, and ABB Robot Studio.

#### General

+ “Stand Up to Work” study: Assisted in executing a 12-month study of employees in the Perkins+Will Atlanta office, funded by the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) and conducted in collaboration with the Center for Active Design, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Steelcase, on standing-desk usage in the workplace. Verified that “on-the-ground” conditions complied with study protocols and communicated user survey instructions and next steps to study participants and local office management.

+ Gadget Lab: Operated, maintained, and debugged a variety of environmental testing and measurement equipment as part of an in-house ‘gadget lab,’ including: sound level and noise dose meters, handheld spectrometers, a distributed ambient temperature and relative humidity sensor kit (“Pointelist”), a smart flooring system, and other devices. Instructed research colleagues on equipment operation and advised on acquisition of additional measurement devices.

+ Miscellaneous: Developed Python scripts to automate tasks for literature search results analysis, light/sound measurement data presentation slides generation. Implemented quasi-Monte Carlo sampling for design of experiments (DoE) via interface with R, and a spectral daylight analytical model (Hosek-Wilkie) as Grasshopper components using the C#. Implemented scripted automation of other administrative tasks using Python.
